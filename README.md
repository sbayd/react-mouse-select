A react component that allows you to use your mouse to select multile objects on webpages just like you do on your desktop!
Included custom render methods so if the user wants to write his/her own methods, they will be used instead of default ones.
The default object that is rendered is <div/>, however that can also be changed.

Index.js is an example.
