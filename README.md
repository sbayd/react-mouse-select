<p> A react component that allows users to select multiple objects by creating squares with their mouses, just like on their desktop!<br/>
It has custom render methods which will override the default render methods I have provided.<br/>
Default render format is div, however that can also be changed.<br/>
The index.js can be used as a reference to understand how to use it.
